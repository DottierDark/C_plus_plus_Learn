# Interesting Facts about C++

## Machine Independent but Platform Dependent:
- A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.
- C++ code can be compiled on different platforms or machines with minimal modifications.

## Nice Facts to Know:
- The name of C++ signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C. “++” is the C increment operator.
- C++ is one of the predominant languages for the development of all kinds of technical and commercial software.
- C++ introduces Object-Oriented Programming, not present in C. Like other things, C++ supports the four primary features of OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance.
- C++ got the OOP features from Simula67 Programming language.
- A function is a minimum requirement for a C++ program to run.
- C and C++ have invented in the same place i.e. at AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph) bell laboratories, located in the U.S.A. 
- Not purely object-oriented: We can write C++ code without using classes and it will compile without showing any error message. The language has some extensions over C, that make OOP and generic programming more convenient.
- Many programming languages are influenced by c++, some of which include C#, Java, and even newer versions of C.
- Concept of reference variables: operator overloading borrowed from Algol 68 programming language.
- A major reason behind the success of C++ is that it supports various programming styles.
- It is a multiparadigm programming language that not only supports the OOP paradigm but also many other paradigms.
