# Important features of C++

## C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include an object-oriented paradigm.

## Object Oriented Programming
- C++ is an Object-Oriented Programming Language, unlike C
- which make it a procedural programming language.
- Most Important Features OF C++ in OOP are:
    - Classes and Objects
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction

## Machine Independent
- C++ is a machine-independent language, which means that it can be used to write programs that can run on different types of computers and operating systems.
- However, C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows), they are machine independent.
- C++ code can be compiled on different platforms with minimal modifications.

## Simple
- C++ is a simple and easy-to-learn language.
- It is based on the C language, which is known for its simplicity and ease of use.
- C++ is designed to be easy to read and write, making it a good choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.
- C++ is a low-level language, which means that it provides direct access to hardware resources
- and allows developers to write code that is close to the machine level.
- This makes C++ a good choice for systems programming and other applications that require direct hardware control.

## High Level Language
C++ is a High-Level Language, unlike C which is a Mid-Level Programming Language.
- C++ is a high-level programming language, which means that it provides a high level of abstraction from the underlying hardware.

## Case-sensitive
- C++ is a case-sensitive language, which means that it distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Compiler Based
C++ is a compiler-based language, unlike Python. That is C++ programs used to be compiled and their executable file is used to run them. C++ is a relatively faster language than Java and Python.

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
- C++ provides dynamic memory allocation, which allows developers to allocate memory at runtime.
- This feature is useful for creating data structures that can grow and shrink as needed.
- C++ provides several operators for dynamic memory allocation, including new, delete, new[], and delete
- These operators allow developers to allocate and deallocate memory as needed.
- Dynamic memory allocation is a powerful feature that allows developers to create complex data structures and algorithms.
- However, it also requires careful management to avoid memory leaks and other issues.

## Memory Management
- C++ provides manual memory management, which means that developers are responsible for allocating and deallocating memory.
- This feature gives developers fine-grained control over memory usage, but it also requires careful management to avoid memory leaks and other issues.

## Multi-Threading
- Multithreading is a specialized form of multitasking and multitasking is a feature that allows your system to execute two or more programs concurrently. In general, there are two sorts of multitasking: process-based and thread-based.
- C++ provides support for multithreading, which allows developers to create programs that can execute multiple tasks concurrently.
- Multithreading is useful for creating programs that can take advantage of multiple processor cores and improve performance.

## Exception Handling
